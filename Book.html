                    book emerged from a
                    Breathwork session in December of 2016. You can also hear her read from the first few pages of the

                <p class="columItem">"Most of us would prefer to gloss over the painful parts of life. It’s easier to
                    push pain down and
                    bury it than to face it, let it tear you apart, and rebuild yourself from the pieces. But that
                    process leads to true healing, as Michelle shows in her book. She takes us into the aftermath of a
                    breakup with the man she loved, spiraling into a darkness that threatens to eradicate her. At the
                    bottom she discovers who she truly is and rises up from a foundation of love and self-acceptance.
                    It’s not pretty, but it’s beautiful in its honesty and openness. This book can offer solace to
                    anyone going through anguish and despair, but it’s not only for them. It’s for everyone who wishes
                    to know the depths and heights of the human heart." <br>

                    feels like a
                    reference volume, or a book of inspirational poetry to keep on your coffee table so you can flip
                    through the pages on those days when you need a little extra guidance or assurance that everything
                    is going to be OK (AKA, all the days). It's easy to read–simple and straightforward, but each
                    sentence packs a complex punch. Example: "Sometime, too early in life, I decided that I wanted to be
                    loved more than I wanted to be me." DAMN. Even if you aren't currently experiencing a "broken
                    heart," you need this book in your life." <br>

                    Michelle will tell you, there is a light and beauty at the end of the tunnel, you just have to look
