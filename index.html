                life. We want to know how to love ourselves.

                Ever since I can remember I've been using writing to process life. I sat in trees listening to mix tapes
                and writing poetry. I hid journals under mattresses and wrote letters to everyone I loved. I have always
                been someone who has felt deeply and who has sought to uncover life's meaning. My heart bled for
                strangers before I knew what an empath was.
            </p>
            <p class="textStandartCSS">
                I felt the longing of my soul constantly pulling me, but I didn't know what it meant or what to do with
                it. I tried to use my mind to figure it out, and when I didn't get anywhere I shoved the feelings away.
                I was often stuck in my head, confused, and frustrated.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h2StandartCSS">
                I spent most of my life trapped within myself.
            </h2>
            <p class="textStandartCSS">
                Because I didn’t know how to listen to my intuition or process my emotions properly, I decided to ground
                myself in the world by emulating qualities I liked. I wanted to be strong, confident, outgoing, and
                independent. So I became those things. Or I should say I pretended to be those things because to be
                those things required me to face some stuff I was not yet prepared to face.
            </p>
            <p class="textStandartCSS">
                I was too busy playing dress up to sit with the truth that I was terrified that who I really was wasn't
                good enough for anyone. I wasted so much time living in my head. I questioned everything I said and did
                always afraid I had made the wrong move. I stayed with boyfriends who were clearly wrong for me for far
                too long. I was deeply insecure and lost but told the world I was strong and confident.

                    <p class="textStandartCSS">Pieces started to fall around me. I was flailing in my career. Money
                        wasn't flowing. I was picking fights with my boyfriend. I didn't like my living situation.
                        Deep
                        inside I felt this horrible feeling like I wasn't living the life I was here to live.
                    </p>
                    <p class="textStandartCSS">Looking back I can see a very clear path at that time in my life.
                        Every
                        aspect of my life was unfolding and pointing me onto that path. I began to pick up on it and
                        started to move forward, and I met my greatest teacher: my own breath. I was lead to begin a
                        Breathwork practice and since that day my life has never been the same.
                    </p>
                    <p class="textStandartCSS">At the time I remember thinking, "How the hell is breathing going to
                        change my life?" Oh, but it did. It dramatically did. This breathing technique was not about
                        relaxation. It was about healing. It was about opening my heart. It was about discovering
                        myself. And that's what I did.

                            now a Breathwork teacher, mentor, writer, and Desire Map facilitator. Every aspect of my

                            about what other people think about me. I don't worry about trying to do it all right
                            because
                            there is no such thing as a right way. I trust myself to make the choices that are best for
                            my
                            life, and I don’t spend my energy questioning myself afterward. I’ve developed a healthy
                            balance
                            between using my mind and my heart.

                            through a terrible heartbreak in 2016, but I have learned tremendously from it. I worked on
                            keeping my heart open. I took the time to heal, as long as it needed. I paid close attention
                            to
                            the wounds the pain was pointing to. I took deep care of myself, like I work to do every
                            day.

                It's necessary if you want to relieve your anxiety, if you want to let go of your pain, if you want to
                accept yourself, if you want to feel any bit better than you do right now. Turning inward and walking
                straight through the pain you're hiding from is the only path to true happiness.
            </p>
            <p class="textStandartCSS">
                This path of looking inward is challenging because of the deep feelings we’ve suppressed and need to
                process. It’s challenging because the ego is hella strong and will do anything it can to dupe us into
                taking the easy route.

                that if you show up to do the work and if you face it all wholeheartedly, what is on the other side is
